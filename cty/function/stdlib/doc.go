// Package stdlib is a collection of cty functions that are expected to be
// generally useful, and are thus factored out into this shared library in
// the hope that cty-using applications will have consistent behavior when
// using these functions.
//
// See the parent package "function" for more information on the purpose
// and usage of cty functions.
